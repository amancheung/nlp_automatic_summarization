Which the man did, and the little pig built a house with it.
Presently came along a wolf, and knocked at the door, and said:

'Little pig, little pig, let me come in.'
So he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew his house in, and ate up the little pig.
The second little pig met a man with a bundle of furze and said:

'Please, man, give me that furze to build a house.'
Which the man did, and the pig built his house.
Then along came the wolf, and said:

'Little pig, little pig, let me come in.'
The third little pig met a man with a load of bricks, and said:

'Please, man, give me those bricks to build a house with.'
So the wolf came, as he did to the other little pigs, and said:

'Little pig, little pig, let me come in.'
said the little pig.
'Very well,' said the little pig, 'I will be ready.
Well, the little pig got up at five, and got the turnips before the wolf came (which he did about six), who said:

'Little pig, are you ready?'
The little pig said: 'Ready!
said the pig.
When the wolf came up he said:

'Little pig, what!
'Yes, very,' said the little pig.
The next day the wolf came again, and said to the little pig:

'Little pig, there is a fair at Shanklin this afternoon, will you go?'
'Oh yes,' said the pig, 'I will go; what time shall you be ready?'
'At three,' said the wolf.
Then the little pig said:

'Hah, I frightened you, then.
