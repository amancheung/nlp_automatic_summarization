The second pigs builds his house out of furze, which are sticks, and just like the first pig, the wolf comes along asking him to open his door. When the pig declines the wolf blows down the house and eats the pig. Finally the wolf goes to the third pigs house and again asks if he can go inside, but when the pig says no, the wolf tries to blow down the house. When he fails he asks the pig if he wants to go to a field of turnips in the morning at a certain time. The pig agrees, but in the morning he goes to the field an hour earlier than planned.
